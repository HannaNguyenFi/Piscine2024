/*
int count = 0 in the countCharacters function:

This line declares an integer variable named count and
initializes it with the value 0.
The purpose of this variable is to
keep track of the number of characters in the string.
As the function iterates through the characters of the string using a loop,
it increments the count variable for each character encountered.

int result
is a variable in the main function
used to store the result (i.e., the count of characters)
returned by the countCharacters function

using char * without const means that
the function has the potential to modify the contents of the string.
If your intention is to have a function that
only counts characters without modifying the string,
using const char * is generally recommended for better code clarity and safety.
